	=================================================================

	Sorts elements in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.
	Selection sort finds the correct spot for the minimum element one at a time, starting with the first
	and finishing with the last.
	This algorithm works on arrays, vectors, and other containers as long as they have the [] operator.
	The algorithm works on integers, doubles, chars, string and other data types as long as they can be compared.

	=================================================================

	Time complexity: O(n^2) for the worst case
	Space complexity: O(1)
	Stability: Not stable by default, but can be made by pushing the minimum element to the front each time instead of swapping
	the elements.
