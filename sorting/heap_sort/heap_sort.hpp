	heap_sort.hpp

	=================================================================

	Sorts elements of a container in ascending order. Uses the heap sort algorithm.
	Heap sort is an improved version of the selection sort. Efficiency is increased by sorting the remaining elements
	in a max heap each time after removing an element.

	A max heap is an almost complete binary tree where the value of the parent is greater than
	the value of their children. We can simulate the max heap with the container we are using where a child cont[i] has
	parent cont[(i-1)/2] assuming cont[0] is the first element in the container.

	This algorithm works on arrays, vectors and other containers as long as they
    have the [] operator and their elements can be compared. The algorithm works on integers, doubles,
    chars, strings and other data types as long as they can be compared (with the < and > symbols).

	=================================================================

	Time Complexity: O(nlogn), Î˜(nlogn)
	Space Complexity: O(1)
	Stability: Not stable.
