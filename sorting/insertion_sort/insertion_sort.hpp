	=================================================================

	Sorts elements in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
	
	Insertion sort works by having a sorted sub-container that starts from the first 2 elements sorted and slowly
	adds new elements by finding their correct position on the already sorted sub-container.

	This algorithm works on arrays, vectors and other containers as long as they
    have the [] operator and their elements can be compared. The algorithm works on integers, doubles,
    chars, strings and other data types as long as they can be compared (with the < and > symbols).
	
	=================================================================

	Time complexity: O(n^2)
	Space complexity: O(1)
	Stability: Stable
