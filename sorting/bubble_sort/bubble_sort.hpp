/*

 *
 *	================================================================
 *
 *	Sorts elements of a container in ascending order by using the bubble sort algorithm.
 *	
 *	Bubble sort relies on continuously comparing 2 adjacent elements and
 *	swapping them if their relative order is wrong.
 *	In this implementation we use an optimized version that finishes when it detects that the order
 *	is already correct.
 *
 *	This function works on arrays, vectors and other containers as long as they	have the [] operator overloaded
 *	and their elements can be compared.
 *	This function works on integers, doubles, chars, strings and other data types as long as they can be compared
 *	with the < and > operators.
 *
 *	=================================================================
 *	
 *	Time complexity: O(n^2)
 *	Space complexity: O(1)
 *	Stability: Stable
